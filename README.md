# Customer Segmentation (Clustering) using K-Means

***Project ongoing***

In this project I use an **unsupervised learning** method to solve a problem of **customer segmentation**. Using the **k-means** model for clustering I locate and classify customers that have similar characteristics, including similar consuming behaviour (spending habits). 

In this (business) context the goal is to identify different sub-groups in the customer database that could be, for example, be targeted by different marketing strategies.

In the data exploration phase I combine <ins>descriptive statistics, visualisation and statistical tests</ins> to understand the data, identify significant features and identify potential clusters. The data contains demographic information (Customer ID, age, gender, annual income) as well as information concerning consuming behaviour represented by a **Spending-Score**.
